# Admin Quest Management UI - Implementation Summary (Phase 1)

## Overview
Successfully implemented **Phase 1** of the Admin Quest Management UI for GoodCred. This enables authorized admins (QuestRegistry contract owner) to create, edit, and manage quests directly through the frontend interface.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Access Control Layer**
âœ… **`useOwnerCheck` Hook** (`/hooks/useOwnerCheck.ts`)
- Verifies if the connected wallet is the QuestRegistry contract owner
- Real-time ownership check via smart contract call
- Returns: `isOwner`, `currentOwner`, `connectedWallet`, `isLoading`, `isConnected`

âœ… **`OwnerGuard` Component** (`/components/admin/OwnerGuard.tsx`)
- Protects admin pages from unauthorized access
- Shows appropriate UI for different states:
  - âœ“ Owner logged in â†’ render protected content
  - âœ— Wallet not connected â†’ "Connect Wallet" message
  - âœ— Not owner â†’ "Access Denied" with owner details
  - âŸ³ Loading â†’ "Verifying access..." spinner
- Redirectable fallback route (default: `/`)

### 2. **Form Infrastructure**
âœ… **Quest Form Schema** (`/lib/questFormSchema.ts`)
- Zod-based validation with full TypeScript support
- Fields:
  - `description` (10-500 chars, required)
  - `targetPoints` (1-500, required)
  - `questType` (ON_CHAIN | OFF_CHAIN, required)
  - Conditional fields for on-chain: `targetContract`
  - Conditional fields for off-chain: `reclaimProvider`, `reclaimDataKey`, `reclaimVerificationUrl`
  - `isActive` (boolean, optional)
  - `deadline` (unix timestamp, optional)
- Refined validation with conditional logic
- Helper: `getDefaultQuestFormData()` for quest-type-specific defaults

âœ… **Admin Utilities** (`/lib/adminUtils.ts`)
- `formatQuestForContract()` - converts form data to contract params
- `formatQuestForDisplay()` - converts contract data to form data (for editing)
- `isValidEthereumAddress()` - validate contract addresses
- `truncateAddress()` - display-friendly address formatting
- Badge color helpers for quest types and status

### 3. **Smart Contract Integration**
âœ… **`useAdminQuests` Hook** (`/hooks/useAdminQuests.ts`)
- Async operations for quest management:
  - `createQuest(formData)` â†’ calls `addQuest()` on contract
  - `updateQuest(questId, formData)` â†’ calls `updateQuest()` on contract
  - `deactivateQuest(questId)` â†’ calls `deactivateQuest()` on contract
  - `activateQuest(questId)` â†’ calls `activateQuest()` on contract
- Returns: transaction hash on success, null on failure
- Error handling with console logging
- Loading states: `isLoading`, `error`, `clearError()`

### 4. **UI Components**
âœ… **`QuestForm` Component** (`/components/admin/QuestForm.tsx`)
- Self-contained form with:
  - Real-time state management (no dependencies on external form libraries)
  - Zod schema validation on submit
  - Conditional field rendering based on quest type
  - Error display per field
  - Loading state disabled form inputs
  - Professional styling with Tailwind CSS
- Fully customizable:
  - `defaultValues` for edit mode
  - `submitButtonText` override
  - `isLoading` state
- Features:
  - Auto-clear field errors when user types
  - All-or-nothing form validation
  - Disabled state during submission
  - Clear error summary banner

### 5. **Admin Pages**
âœ… **Admin Layout** (`/app/admin/layout.tsx`)
- Wraps all admin routes with `OwnerGuard`
- Centered max-width container
- Consistent styling and padding

âœ… **Admin Dashboard** (`/app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Overview page with:
  - Quick stats cards (Total Quests, Active, Completions, Completion Rate)
  - Navigation to quest management
  - Admin info display (Owner + Connected wallet addresses)
  - Placeholder for future settings page

âœ… **Admin Quests Page** (`/app/admin/quests/page.tsx`)
- Quest management interface with:
  - "Create Quest" button (toggles inline form)
  - Expandable quest creation form
  - Placeholder for future quest list table
  - Feature indicators for search, filter, bulk actions (coming soon)

## Architecture & Data Flow

```
User connects wallet
         â†“
useOwnerCheck() verifies ownership via contract
         â†“
OwnerGuard component allows/denies access
         â†“
Admin fills QuestForm
         â†“
Zod schema validates form data
         â†“
useAdminQuests.createQuest() formats & calls contract
         â†“
waitForTransaction() waits for confirmation
         â†“
Success/error handling with console logs
```

- [ ] Form validation works (required fields, format checks)
- [ ] On-chain quest form shows contract address field
- [ ] Off-chain quest form shows provider/key fields
- [ ] Quest creation submits to contract
- [ ] Success message appears after submission
- [ ] Error handling works for failed transactions
- [ ] Form resets after successful submission (optional)

## Usage

### Accessing Admin Dashboard
```
1. Navigate to /admin
2. Connect wallet (must be QuestRegistry owner)
3. Dashboard loads if authorized
4. Click "Manage Quests" button
5. Use form to create/edit/manage quests
```

### Creating a Quest
```
1. Go to /admin/quests
2. Click "Create Quest" button
3. Fill in form:
   - Description: "What users should do"
   - Points: 50 (example)
   - Type: Select ON_CHAIN or OFF_CHAIN
   - If ON_CHAIN: Enter contract address
   - If OFF_CHAIN: Enter provider name & data key
4. Click "Create Quest" to submit
5. Wait for blockchain confirmation
```

## Environment Setup
No additional environment variables needed - uses addresses from contract and ABI constants defined in hooks.

## Integration Notes
- Uses existing `wagmi` and `viem` libraries
- Contract addresses hardcoded (can be moved to config)
- ABI inlined in hooks (can be extracted to constants)
- Minimal external dependencies (only Zod for validation)
- Ready for deployment

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Build quest list table** - display all quests with sorting/pagination
2. **Add quest edit flow** - `/admin/quests/[questId]` page
3. **Implement quest deletion** - with confirmation modal
4. **Add quest analytics** - completion rates, user stats
5. **Create admin settings** - platform configuration
